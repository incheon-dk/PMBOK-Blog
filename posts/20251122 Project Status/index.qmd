## Summary

- Overall CDR package completeness: **~85%**  
- Document freeze: **2025-12-01** (T‐8 days before CDR)  
- Dry-run scheduled: **2025-12-12**  
- Highest near-term risks: firmware memory issue (AI-03), EMC test data (AI-01)

## Action Items (source: meeting notes)

The table below reflects the current set of prioritized action items, owners, and due dates.

```{r} 
# Data and table for Action Items 
library(tibble) 
library(knitr) 
library(lubridate)

report_date <- as.Date("2025-11-17")

action_items <- tibble::tibble( id = c("AI-01","AI-02","AI-03","AI-04","AI-05"), description = c( "Provide EMC pre-test data for CDR", "Deliver updated reliability allocation table", "Submit firmware memory leak fix summary", "Confirm supplier last-buy strategy post-CDR", "Compile full CDR package for dry-run" ), owner = c("US Engineering","EU Systems","India Firmware","Supply Chain","Program Manager"), due = as.Date(c("2025-11-22","2025-11-20","2025-11-23","2025-11-26","2025-11-27")) )

# compute days remaining and status

action_items <- action_items %>% dplyr::mutate( days_remaining = as.integer(due - report_date), status = dplyr::case_when( days_remaining < 0 ~ "Overdue", days_remaining <= 3 ~ "Due Very Soon", days_remaining <= 7 ~ "Due Soon", TRUE ~ "On Track" ) )

kable(action_items, caption = "Action Items Summary (as of 2025-11-17)")

```

# ggplot visualization

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
ai_plot <- action_items %>%
dplyr::arrange(days_remaining) %>%
dplyr::mutate(id = forcats::fct_reorder(id, days_remaining))
