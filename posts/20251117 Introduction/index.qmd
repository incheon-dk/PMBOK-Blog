# Introduction

Project Management, as described and captured in the latest edition, has evolved dramatically over the last decade. What many of us learned as *process groups, ITTOs (*Inputs, Tools, Techniques, and Outputs)*, and detailed workflows* has shifted into a broader, principle-driven view of project management that recognizes that no two projects look the same.

This post breaks down what PMBOK really is (and isn’t), why the 7th Edition shifted direction, and how to use PMBOK as a practical toolkit — not a rigid rulebook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What PMBOK *Is*

PMBOK is:

-   A **framework**, not a methodology\
-   A **set of guiding principles** that help project managers think better\
-   A **structure for managing uncertainty, alignment, and risk**\
-   A **common language** for executives, teams, and stakeholders

Its purpose is to help you deliver value through intentional project leadership.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What PMBOK *Is Not*

PMBOK is not:

-   A step-by-step recipe\
-   A strict set of required processes\
-   A waterfall-only handbook\
-   A replacement for Agile or SAFe\
-   A certification manual (even PMP uses other materials)

It is *methodology-neutral*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why PMBOK 7 Changed

Past editions were heavily process-oriented:

-   5 Process Groups\
-   49 Processes\
-   ITTO tables

But global projects were shifting:

-   More Agile\
-   More hybrid\
-   More product-focused\
-   More uncertainty\
-   More digital workflows\
-   More cross-functional work

PMI realized: **projects need principles, not rigid blueprints.**

Hence: **12 Project Management Principles and 8 Performance Domains**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PMBOK 7 at a Glance

## **12 Principles (Leadership Mindsets)**

-   Stewardship\
-   Team\
-   Stakeholders\
-   Value\
-   Systems thinking\
-   Tailoring\
-   Quality\
-   Complexity\
-   Adaptability\
-   Risk\
-   Change\
-   Delivering value

These are **habits**, not procedures.

## **8 Performance Domains (Execution Realities)**

-   Stakeholders\
-   Team\
-   Development Approach & Lifecycle\
-   Planning\
-   Project Work\
-   Delivery\
-   Measurement\
-   Uncertainty/Risk

Domains represent ongoing areas of *performance*, not phases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What Makes PMBOK Useful Today

PMBOK gives you:

### ✔ A way to structure decision-making

### ✔ A shared vocabulary

### ✔ A strategy for tailoring your delivery approach

### ✔ A consistent method of aligning teams and stakeholders

### ✔ A framework that pairs naturally with Agile, Waterfall, or hybrid delivery

It teaches you *how to think*, *how to adapt*, and *how to lead across complexity*.

# How I Will Use PMBOK in This Blog

Throughout this blog, I will:

-   Deconstruct PMBOK principles into **practical checklists**\
-   Connect PMBOK to **real engineering and regulated-industry** examples\
-   Show how to integrate PMBOK with **R, Quarto, dashboards, and metrics**\
-   Provide **templates for planning, risk logs, RAID logs, and governance**\
-   Demonstrate **tailoring decisions** with real case scenarios

If PMBOK is the map, this blog will be the **road-tested guidebook**.
