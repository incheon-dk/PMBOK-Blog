    "text": "Project Management Is Like Building a Bridge While People Are Already Crossing It\nProject management is like building a bridge while people are already crossing it.\nYou inherit an existing flow of work—operations, customers, expectations—that cannot pause simply because a new project has begun. The organization still needs to function, deliver, and respond to daily pressures, even as you introduce new structures, systems, or processes.\nThe bridge must rise without disrupting the traffic beneath it.\nTo do this, the project manager begins by understanding the load that is already in motion: the constraints, dependencies, and the risks hidden in the environment. Just as an engineer studies foundations, soil conditions, and weight limits, a project manager studies the existing system to determine where the new work can anchor safely.\nEach beam, cable, and joint must be placed in the right sequence.\nEach task depends on another.\nEach decision affects the whole structure.\nStakeholders are like the travelers moving below—each with different destinations, concerns, and tolerances for disruption. Communicating with them is as essential as engineering the structure itself. If they are uninformed or misaligned, the entire construction effort becomes unstable.\nThe crew—the project team—must work in coordinated phases. Some specialize in groundwork, others in high-structure assembly, others in inspection and validation. Their contributions must interlock with precision. A single error early in the process can ripple outward, magnifying costs, delays, or rework.\nAnd through it all, the project manager maintains the delicate balance between progress and stability: advancing the new while protecting the existing.\nWhen the bridge is finally complete, it connects two points that were once difficult to reach. It opens possibilities. It strengthens the entire system. And when done well, the travelers hardly notice the disruption that once existed. They simply enjoy a smoother path forward.\nThis is the quiet achievement of good project management:\nbuilding something new, durable, and valuable—without breaking what people rely on today."

    "title": "Post 1: What’s New in PMBOK 7th Edition?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe shift from the PMBOK Guide 6th Edition to PMBOK Guide 7th Edition is the most significant evolution in the Project Management Institute’s framework in decades.\nInstead of adding more processes, artifacts, and prescribed tools, PMBOK 7 redefines project management around principles, value delivery, and adaptability.\nThis post breaks down what changed—and why these changes matter to modern project managers.\n\n\n\n1. A Shift in Philosophy: Predictive → Flexible\nOlder editions of PMBOK assumed projects were largely predictable and process-driven.\nBut the modern environment? Fast-moving, uncertain, hybrid by default.\nPMBOK 7 responds by shifting to a principle-based guide, making it methodology-agnostic and compatible with:\n\nAgile\n\nWaterfall\n\nHybrid\n\nLean\n\nSystems engineering\n\nRegulated environments\n\nThis flexibility supports real-world complexity instead of prescribing one way to work.\n\n\n\n2. From 49 Processes → 12 Guiding Principles\nPMBOK 6’s 49 processes are no longer the centerpiece.\nPMBOK 7 organizes guidance around 12 principles, such as:\n\nStewardship\n\nTeam collaboration\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nSystems thinking\n\nAdaptation\n\nQuality and value delivery\n\nThese principles are meant to guide decision-making—not constrain it.\n\nNote: The 49 processes still exist in PMI’s Standards+ library for reference.\n\n\n\n\n3. From Knowledge Areas → Performance Domains\nInstead of 10 Knowledge Areas (like Scope, Cost, Schedule), PMBOK 7 uses eight performance domains:\n\nTeam\n\nStakeholders\n\nDelivery\n\nPlanning\n\nUncertainty & Risk\n\nMeasurement\n\nProject Work\n\nDevelopment Approach & Life Cycle\n\nKnowledge areas told you what to manage.\nPerformance domains emphasize how the team behaves to deliver outcomes.\n\n\n\n4. Value Delivery Becomes the Core\nPMBOK 7 embraces the idea that project management’s ultimate goal is value creation, not just scope delivery.\nIt introduces the Value Delivery System, which emphasizes:\n\nAlignment to strategy\n\nBenefits realization\n\nContinuous flow of value\n\nOrganizational learning\n\n\n\n\n5. The PM Is Now a Leader, Not a Process Administrator\nPMBOK 7 elevates the project manager’s role to:\n\nSystems thinker\n\nFacilitator\n\nCoach\n\nDecision enabler\n\nValue steward\n\nThis reflects today’s environment, where PMs must integrate technical, business, and people factors—not just maintain schedules.\n\n\n\n6. Tailoring Is Now Essential\nTailoring has always been recommended; now it is central.\nStructured tailoring considers:\n\nProject type\n\nDelivery approach\n\nGovernance environment\n\nCompliance needs\n\nOrganizational capabilities\n\nThis is especially important in hybrid environments, common in aerospace, R&D, SaaS, and regulated sectors.\n\n\n\n7. Better Alignment with Agile & Systems Thinking\nWhile PMBOK 6 had an “Agile Practice Guide” add-on, PMBOK 7 integrates Agile-compatible concepts directly into the core framework.\nIt also emphasizes systems thinking, which is essential for:\n\nComplex engineering programs\n\nMulti-site organizations\n\nDigital transformation\n\nRegulatory environments\n\n\n\n\n8. No More ITTO Overload\nThe ITTOs haven’t disappeared—they’ve been relocated to PMI’s Standards+ platform.\nPMBOK 7 itself removes the 600+ ITTO details, focusing instead on principles and outcomes, streamlining guidance for real-world application.\n\n\n\n9. Summary Table\n\n\n\nPMBOK 6\nPMBOK 7\n\n\n\n\n49 Processes\n12 Principles\n\n\n10 Knowledge Areas\n8 Performance Domains\n\n\nPrescriptive\nAdaptive, principles-based\n\n\nITTO-heavy\nITTO moved to Standards+\n\n\nMostly predictive\nPredictive + Agile + Hybrid\n\n\nProcess-driven\nValue-driven\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Why This Matters\nPMBOK 7 emphasizes judgment, leadership, and adaptability—skills that differentiate high-performing project managers in complex environments.\nIf PMBOK 6 was about “how to manage a project,” PMBOK 7 is about “how to deliver value in any environment.”\n\n\n\nNext Post Preview\nPost 3: A Practical Mapping: PMBOK 6 → PMBOK 7 Using R and Quarto\n\nComparison framework\n\nR data structures to represent the mapping\n\nVisualizing domains vs knowledge areas\n\nCreating Quarto tables and diagrams automatically\n\n\n\n\nR Code Block Example for Future Visualization\n```{r} # Example: Create a simple PMBOK 6 -&gt; 7 mapping table in R library(tibble) library(knitr)\npmbok_mapping &lt;- tibble( PMBOK6 = c(“49 Processes”, “10 Knowledge Areas”, “Prescriptive”), PMBOK7 = c(“12 Principles”, “8 Performance Domains”, “Adaptive, principles-based”) )\nkable(pmbok_mapping, caption = “PMBOK 6 vs PMBOK 7 Comparison”)"
